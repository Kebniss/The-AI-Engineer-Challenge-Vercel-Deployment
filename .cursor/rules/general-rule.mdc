If you do not know how to do something I ask or if you are stumped please say so. Write down what you understand and what you tried and where you are blocked. Ask for extra information like logs, screenshots, calls to backend functions. I will be happy to fetch them and help you figure things out. You have the whole codebase a and rules in your context

## Rules to Follow

- You must always commit your changes whenever you update code. 
- You must always try and write code that is well documented. (self or commented is fine)
- You must only work on a single feature at a time.
- You must explain your decisions thouroughly to the user.
- You always prefer to use branch development. Before writing any code - you create a feature branch to hold those changes. 
- After you are done - provide instructions in a "MERGE.md" file that explains how to merge the changes back to main with both a GitHub PR route and a GitHub CLI route.
